SUMMARY:Annette Vee on Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing
URL:https://danvers.github.io/oncoding/#av
DESCRIPTION:Annette Vee is Associate Professor of English and Director of the Composition Program\, at the University of Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania where she teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in writing\, digital composition\, materiality\, and literacy. Her teaching\, research and service all dwell at the intersections between computation and writing. She is the author of Coding Literacy (MIT Press\, 2017)\, which demonstrates how the theoretical tools of literacy can help us understand computer programming in its historical\, social and conceptual contexts. Her work is read in dozens of university courses in literacy\, composition\, textual studies\, digital humanities\, and computer science education.

SUMMARY:Eleni-Ira Panourgia on Constructing Behaviour from Physical to Digital: Form\, response and playability across sound and sculpture
URL:https://danvers.github.io/oncoding/#ep
DESCRIPTION:Eleni-Ira Panourgia is a Teaching and Research Fellow (ATER) at Gustave Eiffel University (former Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée). She recently completed a PhD in Art at the University of Edinburgh as a Scholar of the Onassis Foundation. Her research focuses on intersections of sculpture\, spatial dimensions and sound. She is working simultaneously on physical material and sound and is interested in developing an understanding of such complex morphologies and their potential within artistic\, design and social processes. Her research interests also include material exploration\, audio-visual relationships\, participatory and interactive design.

SUMMARY:Juliane Ahlborn on the Computation of Arts Aesthetics - Subject - Education
URL:https://danvers.github.io/oncoding/#ja
DESCRIPTION:Juliane Ahlborn completed her studies of Media Education - Audiovisual Culture and Communication at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg in March 2020. She works as a research assistant at the Centre for Teacher Training at the Otto-von-Guericke University. Furthermore\, she is holding a scholarship of the State of Saxony-Anhalt since July 2020. In her dissertation on Aesthetics - Subject - Education: The computation of arts\, she is concerned with changed structural conditions for education and subjectivation that owe their existence to digital mediality.
