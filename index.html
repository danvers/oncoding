    <h3>A networked series of research colloquiua</h3>
</div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>
<p>We live in a world of algorithmic sorting and decision-making. Mathematical models are curating our social relationships, influencing our elections, and even deciding whether or not we should go to prison. But how much do we really know about code, algorithmic infrastructures and their cultural implications? And what can we learn about creativity in a digital age?</p>
<p>The networked series of research colloquiua on <strong class="name">coding literacy, practices and cultures</strong> with international experts and emerging researchers will give insights to the complexity of coding, digital architectures, and the different cultures code is engaged with in one form or the other. The events will be held with <a href="http://zoom.us">zoom</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="name">Annette Vee</span> is Associate Professor of English and Director of the Composition Program, at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where she teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in writing, digital composition, materiality, and literacy. Her teaching, research and service all dwell at the intersections between computation and writing. She is the author of <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/coding-literacy">Coding Literacy</a> (MIT Press, 2017), which demonstrates how the theoretical tools of literacy can help us understand computer programming in its historical, social and conceptual contexts. Her work is read in dozens of university courses in literacy, composition, textual studies, digital humanities, and computer science education.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
        At this closing event, <span class="name">Winnie Soon</span> and <span class="name">Geoff Cox</span> will talk about their recently published book project: Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook for Software Studies. The project explores the technical as well as cultural imaginaries of programming from its insides. It follows the principle that the growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural thinking — and curriculum — that can account for, and with which to better understand the politics and aesthetics of algorithmic procedures, data processing and abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
        Born and raised in Hong Kong, <span class="name">Winnie Soon</span> (she/they) has a background in Information Systems and Computing (<a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University of Hong Kong</a>), Media Cultures (School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong), Digital Art and Technology (<a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/">University of Plymouth</a>), and has a PhD in Software (Art) Practice (Aarhus University). Her research and practice focus on software publishing, critical technical-art practice, and aesthetic programming. is an artist-researcher interested in queering the intersections of technical and artistic practices as a critical/feminist/queer praxis, with works appearing in museums, galleries, festivals, distributed networks, papers and books. Researching in the areas of software studies and computational practices, she/they is currently based in Denmark and working as Associate Professor at Aarhus University.
